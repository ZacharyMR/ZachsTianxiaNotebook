# The Chinese Dynasties Song

Many of us learned a song by which we could place the various Chinese imperial dynasties in order. 

I have included it here if anyone is interested.

It is sung to the tune of "Mary Had a Little Lamb."

> Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han 
> Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han 

> Sui, Tang, Song 
> Sui, Tang, Song 

>Yuan, Ming, Qing, Republic 
>Yuan, Ming, Qing, Republic 

>Mao Zedong
>Mao Zedong


Some versions of the tune online now change the last verse to say:

> Mao and Deng
> Mao and Deng

However, I think we can all agree that it is not nearly as catchy...
