# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I've created a simple, clean blog using Eleventy with a beautiful minimalist design.

## Features

- **Markdown support** - Write posts in simple markdown
- **Clean design** - Beautiful tan background and typography
- **Fast loading** - No bloat, just content
- **Easy to use** - Just create a new `.md` file in the `posts/` folder

## How to Add New Posts

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `src/posts/` directory
2. Add front matter with title, date, and tags
3. Write your content in markdown
4. The post will automatically appear on the homepage

That's it! Simple and clean.
