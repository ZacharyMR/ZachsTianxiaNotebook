# What is Tianxia?

The Chinese term Tianxia (**天下**), which I included as part of this site's title, translates to "All Under Heaven."

More specifically, it can be broken down into its two component characters: **天**, meaning sky, and **下**, meaning under or below. 

In ancient times, it referred to the whole known world. Or at least what the people in the region we now call China thought was the world anyway...

People in ancient China (and for much of the imperial period) saw 天下 as representing the **cosmic and moral order** of the world. And subsequently viewed the Emperor<sup>1</sup> as ruling "All Under Heaven."

<sup>1</sup> Technically speaking, the first emperor of China was Qin Shi Huang Di, founder of the Qin Dynasty. So, the people using the Tianxia before this weren't exactly dealing with emperors (e.g., during the Zhou dynasty), but you get the idea.
